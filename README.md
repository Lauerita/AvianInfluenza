This mathematical model characterizes the transmission dynamics of avian influenza virus among 
ground-dwelling avian species. The model incorporates the dichotomy of high and low pathogenic variants(HPAI and LPAI) in the dwelling ground. 

One critical assumption of this model is the potential for cross-strain infection, in which individuals in the recovering phase of infection remain susceptible to the heterologous strain.
