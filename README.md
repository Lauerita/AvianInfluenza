## Modeling the Effects of Climate on the Transmission Dynamics of High and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza

This mathematical model characterizes the transmission dynamics of the avian influenza virus(AIV) among 
aquatic avian species. The model incorporates the dichotomy of high- and low-pathogenic variants (HPAI and LPAI) via the periodic temperature changes.

### Abstract:
The evolution of avian influenza (AI) virus among aquatic birds, resulting in the persistence of highly
pathogenic strains, is critical for cross-species transmission to domestic birds and humans, leading to
pandemics. Notably, the climate, specifically environmental temperature, can impose a significant
selection pressure on viral infectivity, determining the persistence of a strain in the evolutionary dynamics
of avian influenza. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the impact
of climate conditions on the transmission dynamics of co-circulating high and low pathogenic AI
strains in a non-migratory aquatic avian species. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate
that warmer temperatures significantly decelerate viral infectivity, thereby reducing environmental
transmission. However, under certain climate and environmental conditions, the reproduction
number of high-pathogenic AI (HPAI) can surpass that of low-pathogenic AI (LPAI) in warmer
months, indicating a potential for HPAI seasonal surges. Sensitivity analyses reveal the critical
role of climate-influenced indirect transmission in viral persistence and HPAI-dominated outbreaks.
Our findings underscore the significance of climate variability in determining and managing HPAI
outbreaks in aquatic bird populations, ultimately providing insights into cross-species transmission
to domestic birds and humans.
