This mathematical model characterizes the transmission dynamics of avian influenza virus among 
ground-dwelling avian species. The model incorporates the dichotomy of high and low pathogenic variants(HPAI and LPAI) via the periodic changes of temperature.

One critical assumption of this model is the potential for cross-strain infection, in which individuals in the recovering phase of one viral strain remain susceptible to the heterologous strain. This assumption represents the co-circulation of the virus within an avian population.
